Our unique programming will challenge and inspire you to get into great shape and feel healthy. On signing up for any of our long term packages for the gym we include PTs and a consultation, after your initial induction we follow up with progressions from your previous program. Whether you play sport, want to lose weight or gain weight, this is the place for you! At BetterBody we do not believe that everybody can benefit from the one generic nutrition plan. All our clients will be extensively analysed during the screening process and throughout so we can get you the results you deserve.</p>
